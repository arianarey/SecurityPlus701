 ## Application
- Memory injection- In this process, there is a starting address and a ending address. Therefore, if you wanted to inject malware into this process you would need to inject it somewhere in between those two addresses. 
  This doesn't just allow malware to avoid detection by anti-malware that's just looking for a malicious process, but this allows the malware to have the same rights and permissions as the process that's injecting into.
- Buffer overflow is an attack where the attacker can write more than what is expected into a particular area of memory and that additional information that they are writing overflows into another area of memory.
- Race conditions is when two events happen nearly at the same time with an application and the application doesn't take into account that these two conditions may be operating simultaneously.
o Time-of-check (TOC) to Time-of-use (TOU) is a race condiction attack
o Time-of-use (TOU) Type of Race condition attack as stated above.
