 ## Application
  Is a program that helps protect a business's network, devices, data, and systems from cyber attacks.

- Memory injection- In this process, there is a starting address and a ending address. Therefore, if you wanted to inject malware into this process you would need to inject it somewhere in between those two addresses. 
  This doesn't just allow malware to avoid detection by anti-malware that's just looking for a malicious process, but this allows the malware to have the same rights and permissions as the process that's injecting into.
- Buffer overflow is an attack where the attacker can write more than what is expected into a particular area of memory and that additional information that they are writing overflows into another area of memory.
- Race conditions is when two events happen nearly at the same time with an application and the application doesn't take into account that these two conditions may be operating simultaneously.
o Time-of-check (TOC) to Time-of-use (TOU) is a race condiction attack
o Time-of-use (TOU) Type of Race condition attack as stated above.
- Malicious update

## Operating system (OS)-based
 This is the program that after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all the other application programs in a computer.

## Web-based
A range of threats and security solutions that protect against online risks.

- Structured Query Language
injection (SQLi)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

## Hardware
 Any device that has an operating system inside of it.

- Firmware
- End-of-life
- Legacy

## Virtualization
  Technology that creates virtual versions of physical machines, such as servers, storage devices, and networks.

- Virtual machine (VM) escape
- Resource reuse

## Cloud-specific
 Is the practice of protecting cloud computing systems from security threats.

## Supply chain
 Involves the process of getting a product from the very beginning raw materials all the way through to the process of providing that product to a consumer.

- Service provider
- Hardware provider
- Software provider

## Cryptographic
The use of encryption techniques to protect data and communications from unauthorized access and theft.

## Misconfiguration
  Is when a system or application is not configured properly, or when essential configurations are missing.

## Mobile device
  Are devices that often require additional policies and procedures along with other different technologies just to be able to provide security. They are small devices and they are also always moving. 
  They contain sensitive info not only to the personal level, but to the organization as well. 

- Side loading
- Jailbreaking

## Zero-day
 Is a security vulnerability in a computer's software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor and has no patch or fix available.
