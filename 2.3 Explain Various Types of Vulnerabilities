• Application
  Is a program that helps protect a business's network, devices, data, and systems from cyber attacks.

- Memory injection- In this process, there is a starting address and a ending address. Therefore, if you wanted to inject malware into this process you would need to inject it somewhere in between those two addresses. 
  This doesn't just allow malware to avoid detection by anti-malware that's just looking for a malicious process, but this allows the malware to have the same rights and permissions as the process that's injecting into.
- Buffer overflow is an attack where the attacker can write more than what is expected into a particular area of memory and that additional information that they are writing overflows into another area of memory.
- Race conditions is when two events happen nearly at the same time with an application and the application doesn't take into account that these two conditions may be operating simultaneously.
o Time-of-check (TOC) to Time-of-use (TOU) is a race condiction attack. This means the applications is going to check the system to retrieve information that may be stored. 
  Then, after in retrieves the information, it may preform a particular function with that value.
o Time-of-use (TOU) Type of Race condition attack as stated above.
- Malicious update are software updates that are designed to harm users by compromising security or damaging a system.

• Operating system (OS)-based
  This is the program that after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all the other application programs in a computer.

• Web-based  
  A range of threats and security solutions that protect against online risks.

- Structured Query Language is a way to have an application interact with a database. Meaning, this will take information that you're inputting into the applcation and use that information as queries into the database.
- SQL injection (SQLi) allows an attacker to put their own requests into this query that's being made to the database.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most common vulnerabilities for web-based applications. This takes advantage of the trust that the browser has for different websites.

• Hardware 
  Any device that has an operating system inside of it.

- Firmware is the operating system that makes everything work inside of a device.
- End-of-life is a notice that the manufacturer is giving to everyone to let them know that in the future they will stop selling a particular product.
- Legacy is a device that might be running an older operating system. 

• Virtualization 
  Technology that creates virtual versions of physical machines, such as servers, storage devices, and networks.

- Virtual machine (VM) escape allows the attacker to get access to one virtual machine and then find their way to connect to other virtual machines on that same hypervisor.
- Resource reuse is the process of re-allocating or assigning system resources to a subject.

• Cloud-specific 
  Is the practice of protecting cloud computing systems from security threats.

• Supply chain 
  Involves the process of getting a product from the very beginning raw materials all the way through to the process of providing that product to a consumer.

- Service provider would be responsible for all the security concerns for those systems.
- Hardware provider are vendors that supplies the components needed to run a data center.
- Software provider is a trusted installation or update into your device.

• Cryptographic 
  The use of encryption techniques to protect data and communications from unauthorized access and theft.

• Misconfiguration 
  Is when a system or application is not configured properly, or when essential configurations are missing.

• Mobile device 
  Are devices that often require additional policies and procedures along with other different technologies just to be able to provide security. They are small devices and they are also always moving. 
  They contain sensitive info not only to the personal level, but to the organization as well. 

- Side loading is the process of transferring media files or apps to a device in a way that is not authorized.
- Jailbreaking is when someone effectivly circumvent all of the security that the owner of the device put in place using your mobile device manager. Jailbreaking gains access to Apple IOS. Root gains access to Android.

• Zero-day 
  Is a security vulnerability in a computer's software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor and has no patch or fix available.
