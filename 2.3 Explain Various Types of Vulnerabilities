 Application
- Memory injection- In this process, there is a starting address and a ending address. Therefore, if you wanted to inject malware into this process you would need to inject it somewhere in between those two addresses. 
  This doesn't just allow malware to avoid detection by anti-malware that's just looking for a malicious process, but this allows the malware to have the same rights and permissions as the process that's injecting into.
- Buffer overflow is an attack where the attacker can write more than what is expected into a particular area of memory and that additional information that they are writing overflows into another area of memory.
- Race conditions is when two events happen nearly at the same time with an application and the application doesn't take into account that these two conditions may be operating simultaneously.
o Time-of-check (TOC) to Time-of-use (TOU) is a race condiction attack. This means the applications is going to check the system to retrieve information that may be stored. 
  Then, after in retrieves the information, it may preform a particular function with that value.
o Time-of-use (TOU) Type of Race condition attack as stated above.
- Malicious update are software updates that are designed to harm users by compromising security or damaging a system.

• Operating system (OS)-based is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all the other application programs in a computer.

• Web-based
- Structured Query Language is a way to have an application interact with a database. Meaning, this will take information that you're inputting into the applcation and use that information as queries into the database.
- SQL injection (SQLi) allows an attacker to put their own requests into this query that's being made to the database.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most common vulnerabilities for web-based applications. This takes advantage of the trust that the browser has for different websites.

• Hardware is any device that has an operating system inside of it.
- Firmware is the operating system that makes everything work inside of a device.
- End-of-life is a notice that the manufacturer is giving to everyone to let them know that in the future they will stop selling a particular product.
- Legacy is a device that might be running an older operating system. 

• Virtualization is a technology that creates virtual versions of physical machines, such as servers, storage devices, and networks.
- Virtual machine (VM) escape allows the attacker to get access to one virtual machine and then find their way to connect to other virtual machines on that same hypervisor.
- Resource reuse is the process of re-allocating or assigning system resources to a subject.

• Cloud-specific is the practice of protecting cloud computing systems from security threats.

• Supply chain involves the process of getting a product from the very beginning raw materials all the way through to the process of providing that product to a consumer.
- Service provider would be responsible for all the security concerns for those systems.
- Hardware provider are vendors that supplies the components needed to run a data center.
- Software provider
