 Application
- Memory injection- In this process, there is a starting address and a ending address. Therefore, if you wanted to inject malware into this process you would need to inject it somewhere in between those two addresses. 
  This doesn't just allow malware to avoid detection by anti-malware that's just looking for a malicious process, but this allows the malware to have the same rights and permissions as the process that's injecting into.
- Buffer overflow is an attack where the attacker can write more than what is expected into a particular area of memory and that additional information that they are writing overflows into another area of memory.
- Race conditions is when two events happen nearly at the same time with an application and the application doesn't take into account that these two conditions may be operating simultaneously.
o Time-of-check (TOC) to Time-of-use (TOU) is a race condiction attack. This means the applications is going to check the system to retrieve information that may be stored. 
  Then, after in retrieves the information, it may preform a particular function with that value.
o Time-of-use (TOU) Type of Race condition attack as stated above.
- Malicious update are software updates that are designed to harm users by compromising security or damaging a system.

• Operating system (OS)-based is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all the other application programs in a computer.

• Web-based
- Structured Query Language is a way to have an application interact with a database. Meaning, this will take information that you're inputting into the applcation and use that information as queries into the database.
- SQL injection (SQLi) allows an attacker to put their own requests into this query that's being made to the database.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
